We can probably speed up the computation by changing how we do
the evaluation.

Instead of having the ValueList structure, we should be able to construct
a single type derived from a list of indexed values, and then pull out the
value we want directly using the function overload resolution technique.

The thing is, I need to be able to construct new values as I'm evaluating.
This seems to be incompatible with using the variadic base class approach.
